# Web_Scraping_Project

Included is my selenium code "zappos_second" for scraping the bulk of information.
It starts at the men's running shoe page and scraps all pages.

The pdf file is my completed project via google sheets

For the user written reviews I created code for each of the 4 models. They are located in the file 'test'.
